# student-performance-prediction

## Introduction

Education is an important element of the society, every government and country in the world work so hard to improve this sector. With the corona-virus outbreak that has disrupted life around the globe in 2020, the educational systems have been affected in many ways; studies show that student’s performance has decreased since then, which highlights the need to deal with this problem more seriously and try to find effective solutions, as well as the influencing factors.

Motivation:
    The educational systems need, at this specific time, innovative ways to improve quality of education to achieve the best results and decrease the failure rate.


## Objectives 

    •	Predict whether or not a student will pass the final exam based on certain information given
    •	Compare the three learning algorithms
    •	Find out what most affects student achievement
    •	Find the best algorithm with high accuracy

We will be using three learning algorithms:

    •	Logistic regression
    •	Supported vector machine
    •	KNN



## Problem Statement:

As already mentioned, with the help of the old students records, we can came up with a model that can let us help students improve their performance in exams by predicting the student success. So, it is obvious it's a problem of classification , and we will classify a student based on his given informations, and we will also use different classifiers such as KNN or SVM classifier and compare between them. Many factors affect a student performance in exams like family problems or alcohol consumption, and by using our skills in machine learning we want to:

    1) predict whether a student will pass his final exam or not.
    2) came up with the best classifier that is more accurate and avoid 
    overfitting and underfitting by using simple techniques.
    3) know what the most factors affect a student performance.


## Dataset:

Dataset name: Student.csv 

Source: Kaggle

## Model

•	The models are hyper tuned to increase their accuracy.

•	Selected SVM for model building as it  provides greater accuracy compared to all other models

•	In SVM the accuracy is identified using three different kernels such as linear, polynomial and gaussian kernel among the three the linear kernel of SVM provides greater accuracy.
